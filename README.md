tsds.jj.info()

# >> <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
#    PeriodIndex: 84 entries, 1960Q1 to 1980Q4
#    Freq: Q-DEC
#    Data columns (total 1 columns):
#     #   Column  Non-Null Count  Dtype
#    ---  ------  --------------  -----
#     0   data    84 non-null     float64
#    dtypes: float64(1)
#    memory usage: 1.3 KB
